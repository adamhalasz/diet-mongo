# **diet-mongo**
A diet plugin for the official node.js mongodb driver:
[https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native][1]

## **Features**
- Simplifies connecting to mongodb
- Creates a mongodb wrapper for diet that can be used in local diet routes.
- the `db.close()` is called automatically on `$.end()` so you don't have to.
- Very small, just 20kb

## **Install**
```
npm install diet-mongo
```

## **Usage**
```js
// Require Diet
require('diet');

// Create App
var app = new App();

// Configure Domain
app.domain('http://example.com/');

// Setup MongoDB
var mongo = app.plugin('diet-mongo');
var db = mongo.db('test');

// Start the Application
app.start();

// Use in Route
app.get('/', db, function($){
    var users = $.db.collection('users');
    users.findOne({ username: 'peter' }, function(err, item) {
        $.data.user = item;
        $.json(); // -> { user: { _id: '4309jg43f234', username: 'peter'} }
    });
});
```

## **One Liner**
If you only need to use one database, you can shorten your call to:
```js
var db = app.plugin('diet-mongo').db('test');
```

## **Methods**
The plugin returns a few methods when you call it:

**mongo.db**
The `database` paremeter is required everything else is optional.
```js
// api
var db = mongo.db(database, port, host, protocol);
```
```js
// example - with the defaults
var db = mongo.db('test', 27017, 'localhost', 'mongodb');
```

**mongo.class**
This is a shortcut for the return values of `require('mongodb')` inside `diet-mongo`.

**mongo.client**
This is a shortcut for the return values of `require('mongodb').MongoClient` inside `diet-mongo`.
